The arm is numb and useless for d10/2 turns.","Your shot slices your target's biceps, exposing red, glistening muscle tissue. He suffers disadvantage to his attack rolls until the end of his next turn.","Your shot penetrates the large muscle connecting your target's shoulder to the upper arm, the arrow/bolt remaining in the wound with the point sticking out the other side. He must pass a DC20 constitution save to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. He also loses use of the arm until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which requires a full action (half an action to break off the head, another to pull the shaft out) either by himself or someone else, plus a successful DC15 constitution save if he does it himself, gritting his teeth against the pain.","Your shot slices the back of your target's hand, severing tendons and nicking the metacarpal bones between the wrist and fingers.

Your target is stunned for d10/2 turns. The arm is useless until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which is very difficult due to the head being firmly embedded in the bone, requiring three full actions either by you or someone else, plus a successful DC20 constitution save if you do it yourself.","Your shot lodges in your target's elbow, severing the head of one of the long bones of the forearm and jamming the joint at a 90-degree angle. Your target is stunned by blinding pain for d10/2 turns and the arm is useless until his HP has been fully recovered. Also the head of the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn. This requires either a successful DC 10 heal check or, if lacking that skill, a DC20 dexterity save, by someone else. Failure means the head was successfully withdrawn but additional damage means healing is delayed, the target must spend two hit dice the next time the recover hit points during a short rest.","Your shot lacerates the target's biceps muscle, also severing the large artery in the arm. Due to the spurting arterial spray, he will suffer a penalty of -2 to strength and dexterity each turn, losing consciousness when either of those ability scores reaches zero. When he wakes up the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn as per #5 above.","Your shot pierces the meaty part of your target's shoulder near the neck, damaging the brachial plexus, the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm.

This takes two full actions and requires a successful  DC10 heal check or a DC20 slight of hand check. Failure means the shaft broke but the head of the arrow remains lodged in your target's ribcage, now instead requiring a successful DC20 heal check and six full actions to remove.","Your shot pierces your target's side, penetrating the wall of muscle and entering his abdominal cavity but missing any internal organs. Your target suffers disadvantage to his attack rolls until the arrow/bolt is removed, requiring two full actions and a successful DC10 heal check or a DC15 slight of hand check. Failure means that the projectile was successfully withdrawn but additional damage was caused, delaying healing, resulting in the target must spend two hit dice the next time the recover hit points during a short rest. In addition to delayed healing, the target must pass a DC20 constitution save or suffer an infection within one day, making him delirious and helpless for d10 days.

If he survives the arrow/bolt will need to be removed as for #6 above.","Your shot penetrates your target's chest, collapsing one lung. He must pass an immediate DC20 constitution save to stay conscious, otherwise suffering -9 to all skill checks and attack rolls, and must roll over 4 on a D20 to prevent death each turn, until magical healing is provided. If he survives, the penalty will be reduced by 3 each week as the lung gradually expands again.","Your shot tears through your target's chest, damaging the aorta where it connects to the heart. The massive loss of blood causes a cumulative penalty of -2 to strength and dexterity each turn, your target falling unconscious when either of those ability scores reaches zero, then and must roll over 4 on a D20 to prevent death each turn, increasing by 4 each turn after the first, as his heart futilely empties his system of blood.

There is a 25% chance the shot went in through the mouth, turning him into a gruesome sight indeed and severing the spinal cord on the way out, otherwise going in through the throat and severing a carotid artery in a gush of blood.

He drops anything held in that hand and will have to pass a Hard (-20%) WP test or count as helpless for d10/2 turns. Success means he'll count as stunned instead. The arm will be useless until the bones have knit after three weeks.

Your opponent screams with pain and horror at the sight of white bone winking at him through the blood, counting as helpless until the end of his next round, then having to pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or turn and flee from your dripping, gory blade. His arm will remain useless until his W characteristic is fully restored.","Your weapon drives deep into your opponent's shoulder joint, damaging the nerves and paralyzing the arm. He'll count as stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty of -20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Afterward he'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test to gradually regain use of his arm after six months. Magical healing will help but count as Hard (-20%) spell test, restoring function in two months. In addition your opponent will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test after 24 hours or suffer a bad infection from such a deep wound to a major joint, forcing amputation or death within 10 days. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection.","Your weapon tears through your opponent's elbow joint, cutting nerves, blood vessels and ligaments. He counts as helpless for d10/2 turns as his lower arm dangles by a few scraps of skin and muscle, gushing blood. He'll also have to pass a T test each turn of faint until a successful Challenging (-10%) Heal test has been performed on him by someone else, stopping the bleeding with a tourniquet. Until he faints or the flow of blood has stopped he'll count as stunned, all will to fight having been taken out of him by the sight of his own mangled limb. The arm will have to be amputated.","Your weapon drives into your opponent's shoulder, just below the collarbone, piercing the top of his lung, causing it to rapidly collapse. He'll suffer a cumulative penalty of -10% to his WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, fainting when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying in another d10 turns unless magical healing is obtained. If he survives he'll regain his characteristics at a rate of 10% per week as his lung slowly inflates itself.","Your weapon slams into your opponent's shoulder from the side, penetrating into his chest cavity, piercing and almost splitting the lung. Your opponent coughs up blood and slides off your blade, dying inevitably in d10/2 turns.","Your weapon enters your opponent's armpit, slamming deep into his chest and piercing his heart. He expires immediately, although you'll have to take a half-action and make a successful Easy (+20%) S test on your next turn to extract your weapon from his limp corpse."],body:["The point of your weapon scores a line across your opponent's chest, causing him to stumble backward. He may not perform any attack action on his next turn.","Your weapon punches into your opponent's chest, sinking in a fraction of an inch, not managing to penetrate his chest wall into the lung but earning your opponent a penalty of -10% to his WS until the end of his next turn.","Your weapon punches into your opponent's belly, not quite managing to penetrate into his abdominal cavity but causing a painful wound and knocking his breath out, forcing your opponent to make a Hard (-20%) T test or be stunned until the end of his next turn. He must then pass a second Challenging (-10%) WP test or suffer a penalty of -10% to any Dodge Blow tests for the rest of the battle due to the ducking and weaving straining belly muscles that pull painfully at the wound.","Your weapon digs into a shoulder and nicks your opponent's collarbone, forcing him to pass a Very Hard (-30%) WP test or drop his weapon.","Your weapon punches into your opponent's belly, only slashing skin and fatty tissue but catching on his clothes or armour, forcing him off balance, able only to use any extra free parry he has, at a penalty of -20% to his WS, until his next turn as he waves his arms to maintain balance. If he is wearing neither clothes nor armour, he will be at a penalty of -30% to his WS next turn due to having his bellybutton suddenly widened by a large red slash.","Your weapon drives into your opponent's left side, driving upward and penetrating through the flesh and muscle into his abdominal cavity, nicking his gallbladder. The results as for Cutting Damage to Body #7.","Your weapon tears a wide red trench across your opponent's hip, leaving gleaming white bone visible.

The effect lasts until his W characteristic is fully restored.","Your weapon drives into your opponent's groin. If male, he screams like a girl and counts as helpless for d10/2 rounds, having to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or be rendered permanently sterile. A female counts as stunned instead.","Your weapon punches deeply into your opponent's belly, between bellybutton and scrotum, puncturing the bladder with results as for Cutting Damage to Body #9.","Your weapon pierces your opponent's chest, puncturing and collapsing one lung. Luckily for him the wound closes quickly and tightly, preventing a much deadlier tension pneumothorax that would leak air into his chest like a one-way valve until the lungs could no longer inflate and the heart no longer beat due to the pressure. His WS, BS, Ag, S and M will be halved as he gasps for breath. The effects last until the air in the pleural sack has drained spontaneously in d10/2 weeks. Magical healing will speed this process into mere days instead of weeks. However, your opponent will also have to pass a Challenging (-10%)T test or contract pneumonia within d10 days, then having to make a second test or die within another d10 days, otherwise being bedridden and delirious for the same amount of time. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure it as well.","The tip of your weapon slams into your opponent's chest, penetrating between the ribs before being withdrawn in a brief spray of blood.

It is an even bet as to whether he expires from breathing difficulties or massive loss of blood first, dying inevitably in a widening pool of blood in d10/2 turns.
