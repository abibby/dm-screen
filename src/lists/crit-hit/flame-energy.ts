        'Flames lick your target’s arm, making any clothes covering it catch fire. Each attempt to put the fire out, waving the arm frantically in the arm, requires a half-action and a successful Challenging (-10%) Ag test, with the target unable to take any other full or half actions until it is out. Lack of clothes, burnable fur or similar equivalent will result in stunning for d10/2 turns instead.',

Lack of hair will instead lead to stunning for d10/2 turns due to a severely blistered noggin’.',
        'Your target is temporarily blinded in one eye, reducing his BS and WS by –10% for the rest of the battle. If already one-eyed, the chance is fifty-fifty that he’ll either be relatively unaffected, as per as #2 above, or fully blinded, counting as helpless.',
        "One side of your target’s face is badly burned, just missing the eye. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping anything held in at least one hand, clapping it to his sizzling face. The heavy scarring resulting from this damage will permanently reduce his Fel by 2d'",

He’ll suffer a penalty of –20% to all tests for 2d10 turns, due to pain and dizziness. After the battle, the loss of skin results in serious risk of infection. He’ll have to pass an Average T test or suffer an infection that will leave him helpless and delirious for d10 days, whereupon he’ll have to make another test to either recover or die. A Shallyan Cure Disease spell will deal with any infection. Because of the exposed bone and the skin not being able to grow back over it properly, any time the target is exposed to sources of contamination (such as walking through a swamp or sleeping in a dirty barn), the GM might force him to repeat those tests. Magical healing will let the skin grow back, preventing this.',

Fel will be permanently reduced by –20% and he’ll have to pass an Average T test for each eye to retain sight.

        'A white-hot jet of flame tears into the target’s neck, frying the spinal cord. He’ll have to make an immediate Hard (-20%) T test or die within d10/2 turns from brain damage as well, knocking out his respiratory control centre. If he survives he’ll be paralyzed from the neck down. In addition, there is a 50% chance he’ll suffer the results of #8 as well, due to the front of the neck getting a dose of flame as well.',

Unless the burns are magically healed, half that penalty will permanently remain, due to contractions and scarring.",
        'Most of the skin on the front of the leg is burned away, setting fire to any pants as per #4 above.

Even then he will have a permanent reduction of M to 1 and suffer a penalty of -30% to any Dodge Blow tests, due to a thoroughly stiff joint and insensible nerveless leg. If magical healing is provided, the penalties will be reduced to -2 to M and -20% to Dodge Blow, restoring at least some function.",
        "Flames engulf the entire leg, putting the target's pants on fire and felling him to the ground, both hands beating frantically at the flames as he mewls piteously. Putting the flames out will require a full action and a Hard (-20%) Ag test. Lack of clothes, burnable fur or similar equivalent will result in stunning for d10/2 turns instead. Afterwards, he'll suffer -30% to all tests due to the agony and the leg will be a blistered, scorched mass of flesh with shreds of skin hanging from it, utterly useless until the target's W characteristic has been fully restored.
