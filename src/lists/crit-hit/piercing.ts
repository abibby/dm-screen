        "Your weapon stabs into your opponent's shoulder, driving into the large deltoid muscle, forcing him to make a Hard (-20%) T test or drop whatever he is holding in that hand. Also, for the duration of the battle, he will suffer a penalty of -10% to any WS tests made with that arm, as well as a penalty of -1 to his SB due to not being able to put his full strength behind any blow with that arm.",
        "Your weapon impales your opponent's hand through the palm, driving in between the bones between the wrist and fingers, but not severing any major tendons, blood vessels or nerves. Your opponent drops anything held in that hand and will suffer a penalty of -20% to all tests until your weapon is withdrawn from his hand, which requires a half-action either by you, to pull it out, or him, to yank his handoff the blade. Letting go of the weapon counts as having withdrawn it. If he does it himself he'll have to first pass a successful Challenging (-10%) WP test.",
        "Your weapon deeply pierces your opponent's upper arm, opening a gaping wound. He must make a Hard (-20%) T test to avoid dropping anything he is holding in that hand and suffers a penalty of -20% to WS and -2 to SB for any attacks or parries made with that arm for the duration of the battle.",
        "Your weapon impales your opponent's forearm, lodging between the radius and ulna, the long bones of the forearm, lacerating the muscles controlling several fingers as you yank it out in preparation for your next blow. Anything held in that hand is dropped and your opponent is stunned until he can pass a Challenging (-10%) T test. Also, he cannot use his arm until his W characteristic is fully restored, afterward suffering a penalty of -10% to any WS tests as well as any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand due to not being able to flex his fingers properly. Successful magical healing removes this penalty. Alternatively, a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test with the Surgery Talent will manage to stitch back enough of the muscles and tendons to halve that penalty.",
        "Your weapon drives into the soft tissues at the inside of your opponent's elbow, severing the major blood vessels. Anything held in that hand is dropped as blood gushes forth, forcing your opponent to grab his elbow with the opposite hand in an attempt to arrest the flow of blood. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and must then choose whether to let go and continue fighting with the other hand, suffering a 5% risk of fainting from loss of blood each turn, or to hold on and be able to do nothing else except turn and flee from you. A successful Heal test will stop the bleeding, although your opponent will count the test as Hard (-20%) if attempting to tie the tourniquet himself with the remaining hand and his teeth, requiring two full actions. The arm will remain useless until his W characteristic is fully recovered.",
        "Your weapon pierces your opponent's forearm, driving in between the radius and the ulna, the long bones of the forearm, snapping the radius and chipping the ulna as you savagely twist your weapon when withdrawing it. He drops anything held in that hand and will have to pass a Hard (-20%) WP test or count as helpless for d10/2 turns. Success means he'll count as stunned instead. The arm will be useless until the bones have knit after three weeks. Also, due to damaged nerves and tendons, he'll suffer a permanent penalty of -20% to any WS tests as well as any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that hand due to not being able to use his hand properly.

Your opponent screams with pain and horror at the sight of white bone winking at him through the blood, counting as helpless until the end of his next round, then having to pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or turn and flee from your dripping, gory blade. His arm will remain useless until his W characteristic is fully restored.",
        "Your weapon drives deep into your opponent's shoulder joint, damaging the nerves and paralyzing the arm. He'll count as stunned for d10/2 turns and then suffers a penalty of -20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle. Afterward he'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test to gradually regain use of his arm after six months. Magical healing will help but count as Hard (-20%) spell test, restoring function in two months. In addition your opponent will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test after 24 hours or suffer a bad infection from such a deep wound to a major joint, forcing amputation or death within 10 days. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection.",
        "Your weapon tears through your opponent's elbow joint, cutting nerves, blood vessels and ligaments. He counts as helpless for d10/2 turns as his lower arm dangles by a few scraps of skin and muscle, gushing blood. He'll also have to pass a T test each turn of faint until a successful Challenging (-10%) Heal test has been performed on him by someone else, stopping the bleeding with a tourniquet. Until he faints or the flow of blood has stopped he'll count as stunned, all will to fight having been taken out of him by the sight of his own mangled limb. The arm will have to be amputated.",
        "Your weapon drives into your opponent's shoulder, just below the collarbone, piercing the top of his lung, causing it to rapidly collapse. He'll suffer a cumulative penalty of -10% to his WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, fainting when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying in another d10 turns unless magical healing is obtained. If he survives he'll regain his characteristics at a rate of 10% per week as his lung slowly inflates itself.",
        "Your weapon slams into your opponent's shoulder from the side, penetrating into his chest cavity, piercing and almost splitting the lung. Your opponent coughs up blood and slides off your blade, dying inevitably in d10/2 turns.",
        "Your weapon enters your opponent's armpit, slamming deep into his chest and piercing his heart. He expires immediately, although you'll have to take a half-action and make a successful Easy (+20%) S test on your next turn to extract your weapon from his limp corpse.",

        "Your weapon punches into your opponent's belly, not quite managing to penetrate into his abdominal cavity but causing a painful wound and knocking his breath out, forcing your opponent to make a Hard (-20%) T test or be stunned until the end of his next turn. He must then pass a second Challenging (-10%) WP test or suffer a penalty of -10% to any Dodge Blow tests for the rest of the battle due to the ducking and weaving straining belly muscles that pull painfully at the wound.",
        "Your weapon digs into a shoulder and nicks your opponent's collarbone, forcing him to pass a Very Hard (-30%) WP test or drop his weapon.",
        "Your weapon punches into your opponent's belly, only slashing skin and fatty tissue but catching on his clothes or armour, forcing him off balance, able only to use any extra free parry he has, at a penalty of -20% to his WS, until his next turn as he waves his arms to maintain balance. If he is wearing neither clothes nor armour, he will be at a penalty of -30% to his WS next turn due to having his bellybutton suddenly widened by a large red slash.",

        "Your weapon tears a wide red trench across your opponent's hip, leaving gleaming white bone visible. Your opponent is knocked to the ground, counting as stunned until the end of his next turn. He must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test before attempting to get up and must then pass additional tests each turn he wants to move at a rate faster than a slow walk, due to the pain of torn muscles. The effect lasts until his W characteristic is fully restored.",
        "Your weapon drives into your opponent's groin. If male, he screams like a girl and counts as helpless for d10/2 rounds, having to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or be rendered permanently sterile. A female counts as stunned instead.",
        "Your weapon punches deeply into your opponent's belly, between bellybutton and scrotum, puncturing the bladder with results as for Cutting Damage to Body #9.",
        "Your weapon pierces your opponent's chest, puncturing and collapsing one lung. Luckily for him the wound closes quickly and tightly, preventing a much deadlier tension pneumothorax that would leak air into his chest like a one-way valve until the lungs could no longer inflate and the heart no longer beat due to the pressure. His WS, BS, Ag, S and M will be halved as he gasps for breath. The effects last until the air in the pleural sack has drained spontaneously in d10/2 weeks. Magical healing will speed this process into mere days instead of weeks. However, your opponent will also have to pass a Challenging (-10%)T test or contract pneumonia within d10 days, then having to make a second test or die within another d10 days, otherwise being bedridden and delirious for the same amount of time. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure it as well.",
        "The tip of your weapon slams into your opponent's chest, penetrating between the ribs before being withdrawn in a brief spray of blood. Unknown to your opponent, the blade has nicked his heart, each beat pumping as much blood into his chest cavity as into his arteries. He'll suffer a cumulative penalty of -10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, collapsing and dying when any of those characteristics reaches zero. Only very fast magical healing can close the wound to the heart in time to save his life, regaining his lost characteristics at a rate of 10% per week as his body replenishes the massive amount of blood lost.",
        "You slice open your opponent's belly, cruelly twisting the blade in the wound before withdrawing it, spilling red ruin at his feet. The effects are as for Cutting Damage to Body #12.",
        "You ram your weapon into your opponent's solar plexus, rupturing the diaphragm muscles he breathes with and damaging the abdominal aorta. It is an even bet as to whether he expires from breathing difficulties or massive loss of blood first, dying inevitably in a widening pool of blood in d10/2 turns. A last-ditch desperate attempt at magical healing may be performed before then, at a penalty of -30% to the spell test, success leaving him unconscious but alive with a permanent penalty of -20% to S and T due to reduced breathing capacity.",

        "Your weapon glances over your opponent's scalp, catching on and flicking away any helmet or hat he might wear. A chain coif sits too tightly to be removed so easily.

He now has problems holding his head up and turning it quickly, suffering a penalty of  -20% to all dodges and parries for the duration of the battle.

A lack of beard or Viking ancestry results in only a lack of bragging rights, however.

        "Your weapon pierces the cartilage of your opponent's larynx at the upper part of the windpipe, making air whistle out of the hole as he breathes or talks. He must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test or drop everything and grasp at his throat as he gasps and sputters helplessly for d10/2 turns.

        "You stab into your opponent's face, crumbling the cheekbone and piercing the sinus behind it, opening up his face gruesomely. Your opponent is stunned for d10 turns. In addition he'll have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test after 24 hours or contract an infection, which will leave him delirious and raving for d10 days, dying unless he can pass a second test. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will save him. If he survives his Fel will be reduced by -5% due to ugly facial scarring.",

        "You pierce one of your opponent's eyes. He counts as helpless with pain until he can pass a Hard (-20%) T test, making his first test the turn after his next.

Also, he must permanently reduce any BS or sight-based Perception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter.",
        "Your weapon slams into your opponent's cheek, piercing the sinus and ripping into the bony orbit around one eye, destroying it and causing risk of infection as for #9 above. Stunning and effects for the lost eye are as for #11 above, but also reducing Fel by 10% due to major scarring visibleeven with a large patch for the eye.",

Afterward, his M is halved and all Dodge Blow tests are counted as Very Hard (-30%) from now on, due topoor balance on a badly unstable knee.

After a number of turns equal to his TB he'll suffer a cumulative penalty of -5% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn. When any of those characteristics reaches zero he falls unconscious.
