        "Your weapon smashes into your opponent's shoulder, bruising it badly. Anything held in that hand is dropped and your opponent is at half SB and a penalty of -20% to his WS for any attacks or parries made by that arm for the duration of the battle.",

The hand is useless until the bones have healed in d10/2 weeks and he will then suffer a penalty of -10% to WS tests or tests requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand afterward due to improperly set bones unless a successful Heal test has been made to reset them the first week. Magical healing will automatically do this, as well as speeding up the healing process, ignoring the longer time required.",

Your opponent is helpless with pain for d10 rounds. The arm will be useless until the bones have knitted in d10 weeks. Only magical healing will restore the full function of the arm, which will otherwise suffer a penalty of -10% to all WS, S and Ag tests in which it is used due to stiffness and damaged nerves, assuming it is cared for with a successful Hard (-20%) Heal test. If the damage is left untended by mundane or magical healing the badly healed joint raises the penalty to -20%.",

    body: [
        'Your weapon punches your opponent in the belly, momentarily winding him. He loses a half- action while recovering.',

        'You connect solidly and squarely with your opponent’s solar plexus, driving his breath from his body. He cannot attack next turn and suffers a penalty of –20 % to any parryuntil the end of that turn.',
        'Your blow glances against your opponent’s groin, forcing him to make an immediate Very Hard(-30 %) T test to avoid spending until the end of his next turn helpless, puking his guts out. If female or otherwise non - equipped in the scrotal department the test is only Challenging(-10 %) and failure causes only stunning.',
        'Your blow contuses several of the ribs underneath your opponent’s arm. His WS is reduced by –20 % for the next d10 / 2 turns.',
        'Your weapon crashes into your opponent’s side, damaging his spleen, causing slow internal bleeding as that organ’s tough membranous covering tries to contain the steady leakage of blood. Your opponent suffers no ill effects during the remainder of this battle apart from being stunned until the end of his next turn, but he will have to make a Hard(-20 %) T test after the battle or suffer a cumulative –5 % to his WS, BS, Ag and S each hour. If he receives magical healing before any of those characteristics reaches zero his life will be saved, otherwise he will fall unconscious and die within the next 2d10hours. A surgical operation to remove the damaged spleen is also possible, although it will require a successfulHeal test with the Surgery Talent. Failure will result in the death of the patient. If successful, he’ll still have to pass a Hard(-20 %) T test or contract a lethal infection, dying within d10 / 2 days unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is preformed. Without a spleen, his immune system will have been weakened, making him suffer a penalty of –10 % to resist infections in the future.',
        'Your blow breaks several ribs, stunning your opponent until the end of his next turn. He will also suffer a penalty of –20 % to all actions as he gasps for breath and guards his ribs, until his W characteristic has been healed up to Lightly Wounded.',
        'Your blow connects solidly with your opponent’s hip, fracturing one wing of the pelvis - bone. He falls immediately to the ground and counts as helpless from the pain until he can pass a Hard(-20 %) T test, getting one roll each turn.

        'Your weapon crashes into your opponent’s sternum, temporarily causing paralysis of his breathing musculature and cardiac arrhythmia as his hearts starts beating irregularly.

        'Your blow shatters ribs, pushing splinters into internal organs, causing internal bleeding and a 50 % chance of a collapsed lung. If that happens your opponent will suffer a penalty of –20 % to all tests before collapsing unconscious after d10 / 2 turns and dying after an additional d10 / 2 turns. Only magical healing can save his life. If his lungs survive intact he’ll still suffer a penalty of –20 % to all tests until his ribcage has healed in four weeks.',
        'Your blow shatters your opponent’s shoulder - blade, causing a penalty of –20 % to all tests until his W characteristic has been fully restored. In addition there is a50 % chance of the blow also having glanced into his spine, causing spinal injury and resulting in total paralysis from the waist down. If your opponent passes a Challenging(-10 %) T test the paralysis was caused only by swelling from a cracked vertebra and he will recover from his paralysis in d10 / 2 weeks.',
        'Your opponent is hit squarely between his shoulder - blades as he twists to avoid your blow, fracturing his spine. He falls immediately to the ground, paralysed from the waist down. He must make a Hard(-20 %) WP test each turn to stay conscious. After falling unconscious he must make a Challenging(-10 %) T test or die before regaining consciousness. If he survives he will remain paralysed, as not even magical healing can restore him, and will gain one extra IP and be plagued by constant nightmares, reliving the moment of his trauma.',
        'Your blow hits your opponent’s breastbone with a mighty crack, fracturing and compressing it against the heart. Unbeknownst to your opponent, the shearing force has partly torn the aorta away from the heart, causing the pericardial sack surrounding the heart to fill up with blood, preventing it from beating properly. He will suffer a cumulative penalty of –15 % to his WS, BS, Ag and S each turn as his heart can no longer beat within the rapidly filling pericardium. When any of those characteristics reaches zero he will collapse dead. No mundane or magical healing can save him.',
        'Your blow drives pieces of your opponent’s breastbone and ribs into his lungs and heart, causing frothy blood to erupt from his mouth as he staggers backward and collapses. Death is inevitable within one turn.',
        'Your blow smashes your weapon straight through the front of your opponent’s ribcage, caving it in and killing him instantly. On your next turn you must take a half - action and pass either an S or Ag test to withdraw your weapon from your fallen foe’s chest cavity.',

        'Your blow connects to your opponent’s head with a sickening thud. Concussed, he falls to the ground, counting as helpless until he can make a Hard(-20 %) T test to regain full consciousness, starting to roll during his next turn, re - rolling each turn until he succeeds. For the rest of this battle he will suffer a –10 % penalty to his WS, BS and Ag due to dizziness and nausea. He must also make a Challenging(-10 %) test or suffer short - term amnesia, not remembering a thing about the battle or how he ended up in it.',
        'Your weapon fractures your opponent’s nose, stunning him until the end of his next turn as he sees bright flashes and spits blood. On his next turn after that he must pass a Challenging(-10 %) T test to recover, re - rolling each turn until he succeeds. There is a 50 % chance that the nose will be so smashed it reduces his Fel by d10 % unless magically healed or set with a successful Heal test by someone with the Surgery Talent.',
        'Your blow crashes into your opponent’s skull, stunning him until the end of his next turn. On his next turn after that he must pass a Hard(-20 %) T test to recover, re - rolling each turn until he succeeds. The blow has fractured his skull, causing a splinter of bone to press into his brain and starting a slow bleeding between the brain and the skull that will keep expanding, eventually killing him unless pressure is relieved. He’ll suffer a cumulative penalty of –5 % to his WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel every two hours, falling into a coma when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying within another d10 / 2 days. The only effective cure is a procedure called trepanation, which involves removing a piece of the skull by drilling or boring into it, thus relieving the pressure and allowing access to remove the splinter. This requires at least one hour and a Challenging(-10 %) Heal test with theSurgery Talent. If successful, a metal plate of some kind, usually a silver coin that has been hammered flat and polished, is used to cover the hole, nailed directly to the surrounding bone and then covered with a flap of the scalp. If already in a coma, your opponent will then wake up in another d10 / 2 days, otherwise regaining his lost characteristics at a rate of 5 % per day. Failure will still relieve the pressure but causes brain damage, reducing WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel by –10 % permanently. Regardless of outcome, your opponent will have to pass a Challenging(-10 %) T test immediately after the surgery or contract a serious infection, killing him within d10 days unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell is performed.',
        'Your weapon breaks your opponent’s jaw. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and then suffers a penalty of –20 % to his WS and BS for the remainder of the battle due to the pain. The jaw will have to be wired or otherwise tightly shut until knitted together in d10 / 2 weeks, forcing your opponent to eat through a straw until then. There is also 50 % risk that he’ll have lost several teeth, in which case his Fel will be reduced by - 5 % unless he already had missing or unsightly teeth(GM’s call).',
        'Your weapon crashes into your opponent’s larynx at the top of the windpipe, causing a spasmed airway. He gasps for breath, suffering a cumulative penalty of –10 % to his WS, BS, Ag and S each turn until he makes a Challenging(-10 %) T test to immediately regain the lost characteristics points, rolling at the start of each turn. If any of the characteristics reaches zero he falls unconscious from lack of air. If not making his roll within another TB turns he dies from lack of air.',
        'Your weapon crushed the bony orbit surrounding your opponent’s eyeball, causing a blow - out fracture, pushing bone splinters into the sinus and trapping some of the muscles controlling eye movement. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn. On his next turn after that he must pass a Challenging(-10 %) T test to recover, re - rolling each turn until he succeeds. Unless magical healing is received within d10 days the eye will be effectively lost and he must reduce any BS or sight - based Perception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter.',
        'Your blow tears loose your opponent’s jaw. He must make an immediate Challenging(-10 %) T test or fall unconscious. If successful, he can only stumble around and try to hold his dangling jaw in place, counting as helpless for the duration of the battle. If he survives, either a Challenging(-10 %) Heal test with the Surgery Talent or magical healing is needed reattach the jaw. It must be done within d10 / 2 days, otherwise necessitating amputation of the whole lower jaw. Apart from looking absolutely hideous and being forced to feed only on liquids and losing all speech, your opponent must also reduce his Fel by –30 %.',
        'Your weapon smashes into the junction between head and neck, breaking your opponent’s spine. He falls unconscious and will die within d10 / 2 hours from loss of air due to damage to the breathing centre in the upper part of the spinal cord. Magical healing can save his life but will be Hard(-20 %) and will still leave him paralysed from the neck down and gains him d10 / 2 IP due to the horrible experience of being paralysed and helpless while slowly suffocating to death.',

        "Your blow crushes your opponent's foot, fracturing several of the bones between ankle and toes. He falls to the ground and will be unable to put any weight on that foot and thus to rise for the duration of the battle. He'll be effectively one - legged until the bones have healed in four weeks.
