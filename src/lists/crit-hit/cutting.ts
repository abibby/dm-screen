        "Your weapon slices across your opponent's fingers. He must make an immediate Challenging (-10%) T test or drop what-ever he is holding in that hand.",
        "Your weapon bites into the target's biceps muscle. Until he has healed at least one W, any attacks or parries made with that arm will suffer a penalty of –20% to WS, BS and S.",
        "Your weapon drives into the large deltoid muscle of your opponent's shoulder, sending a shock down the entire arm, causing whatever is held in that hand to be dropped. For the rest of the combat he suffers a penalty of –10% to his WS, due to the pain.",
        "Your weapon opens up your opponent's forearm, slicing open the skin to expose red, twitching, glistening layers of muscle. Anything held in that hand is dropped and the opponent must pass a Challenging (-10%) WP test or count as stunned until the end of his next turn, staring at the hideous sight. If he fails he'll drop anything held in the other hand, grasping at the wound in an attempt to close it. He may at-tempt another test on each subsequent turn to recover from this, now at his unmodified WP.",
        "Your weapon slices into your opponent's forearm, rebound-ing from the bone. Anything held in that hand is dropped and the hand is useless until his injury level is changed back to Lightly Wounded.",
        "Your weapon slices into your opponent's forearm, damaging muscles and tendons, lodging in the bone for a fraction of a second before being wrenched loose. Your opponent is stunned until the end of his next turn and the hand is useless until his W characteristic is fully restored. In addition, he'll suffer a permanent penalty of –10% to any tests requiring fine manipulation made with that arm, due to difficulties opening the fingers properly.",
        "Your weapon severs your opponent's biceps muscle from its tendonous attachments to the bones in the forearm. The en-tire arm is useless until his W characteristic is fully restored. However, magical healing or a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent is needed to restore full function; otherwise any use of that arm will suffer a –20% penalty, including for WS, BS and S tests, due to the severed muscle and tendon ends not knitting together properly, making it difficult to flex the arm.",
        'Your weapon cleanly slices a large chunk of flesh from the meaty part of the upper arm and shoulder. Anything held in the hand is dropped, your opponent cannot use that arm and suffers a penalty of  –20% to his WS for the duration of the combat due to pain and bleeding. He must also make an immediate Hard (-20%) T test or fall to the ground from the intense pain.',
        "Your weapon severs d10/2 fingers from your opponent's hand. A result of 5 means the whole hand has been lopped off. He must make an immediate Hard (-20%) WP test or count as stunned until the end of his next turn. If more than two fingers are lost anything in that hand is dropped as well and it can no longer be used to hold any weapons. Any tasks requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand in the future suffers a penalty of –5% to any such test, per finger lost, with no task at all possible if the whole hand has been lost. If the whole hand has been severed your opponent will suffer a penalty of –10% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to shock and bleeding.",
        "Your opponent's arm is severed at the elbow. Blood pumps out in bright spurts and he suffers a 20% chance of fainting from loss of blood each turn until a successful Heal test has staunched the bleeding, requiring two full turns of bandaging or a good burning, cauterizing the wound. If left untended and unconscious he will bleed to death, suffering a 10% chance of dying each turn once unconscious.",
        "Your weapon slashes deeply into your opponent's shoulder, severing the collarbone. There is a 50% chance the large artery of the shoulder is severed or the tip of the lung punctured, in which case he'll suffer a cumulative penalty of –10% to all WS, BS, S and Ag each turn, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero, dying within another d10 turns unless magical healing is provided. Even if he survives the blow the arm will be useless and he'll suffer a penalty of –20% to all WS, BS, S and Ag tests until his W characteristic is fully restored and the stump healed.",
        "Your opponent's arm is severed cleanly at the shoulder, resulting in gouts of blood pouring from the ruined stump, causing his death within five turns unless magical healing can be obtained, which, however, cannot restore the arm. Your opponent falls immediately unconscious in a twitching heap.",
        "Your weapon drives cleanly through your opponent's shoulder near the junction between body and neck and continues deep into his chest cavity. Your surprised adversary can only stare at you as he slides slowly off your blade and into oblivion, dying inevitably within d10/2 turns.",

        'You slash your opponent across the chest, rending his cloth- ing or causing an unsightly scrape or laceration across his armour.As your opponent stumbles backward he will not be able to perform any attack action on his next turn.If he is wearing neither armour nor clothing the blade will slice the skin, causing him to flinch and earning him an extra –10 % penalty to any parries made until the end of his next turn apart from not being able to attack.',
        'A long cut along a rib leaves white bone gleaming through the wound.The shock and pain earns your opponent a penalty of –10 % to all actions until the end of his next turn.',
        "Your weapon cuts into the soft tissues over your opponent's collarbone, chipping the bone.He must make a Very Hard(-30 %) WP test or drop his weapon.",
        "Your weapon splits one of your opponent's ribs.He must make a Hard(-20 %) T test or count as stunned until the end of his next turn as he gasps for breath.For the rest of this battle he will suffer a penalty of –5 % to any parries due to the pain from the damaged chest muscles connecting to his shoulder and upper arm.",
        "Your weapon slices across your opponent's chest, splitting open leather or mail links and dislodging any shoulder plates, reducing the AP of his body armour by 1. If he is not wearing any armour the result will be as for #4 above.",
        "You carve deeply into your opponent's side, lodging your weapon in the bony portion of his hip.He falls to the ground, writhing in pain, causing him to count as helpless until the end of his next turn.On your next turn you must make an Easy(+20 %) S test to dislodge your weapon, whereupon you can take a full action as normal.Until you succeed you will be unable to use the weapon and your opponent will continue to be counted as stunned due to the excruciating pain of your wrenching and twisting of your weapon in his wound.Letting go of your weapon counts as having dis - lodged it.Your opponent can try to tear himself free by pass both an Average WP test and an Easy(+20 %) S test, an exception to the rule of not being able to perform any actions when stunned, although he'll still count as helpless on that turn, regardless of whether or not he succeeds.",
        "Your weapon drives into the right side of your opponent's abdomen, just underneath the ribs, penetrating the wall of flesh and muscle into his abdominal cavity and nicking the gallbladder.Your opponent must make a Hard(-20 %) T test or be stunned for d10 / 2 turns.In addition, he must make a Very Hard(-30 %) T test or die from infection in d10 days(becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing, the Shallyan Cure Disease spell or a Very Hard(-30 %) Heal test with the Surgery Talent is made within half that time.The latter involves a very risky surgical procedure, digging deep into the abdomen, stitching up the holes and cleaning out any gall or other foul sub - stances visible.",
        "Your weapon slices into your opponent's groin, causing dramatic bleeding and stunning him for d10 turns(d10 / 2 if female).He'll suffer a penalty of –10 % to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to the pain.In addition there is a 50 % risk he will be rendered permanently sterile from the injury(10 % if female).",
        "Your weapon slices into your opponent's belly and groin, puncturing the bladder.With a faint odour of ammonia, urine spills from the wound and onto your blade.Your opponent must make a Challenging(-10 %) WP test or gain one extra IP as he realizes what has happened.He will suffer a penalty of –20 % to all actions for the rest of the battle.Fortunately, urine is more or less sterile, meaning he will only have to make a Challenging(-10 %) T test to avoid contracting a lethal infection as for #7 above.If he survives he must make a Challenging(-10 %) T test or be prone to leakage and constantly reek of urine, permanently reducing his Fel by –10 %.",
        'Your weapon cuts through the lower left ribs and drives deep into the abdominal cavity, lacerating the spleen.The heavy internal bleeding resulting from this will cause a cumulative loss of –5 % to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn.When any of those characteristics reaches zero your opponent falls unconscious and will die within d10 / 2 hours unless successful magical healing or a successful surgery is performed.In the latter case the procedure is as for Blunt Damage to Body #6 except that time is quickly running out, leaving less time for getting your opponent to a surgeon.',
        "Your weapon deeply penetrates your opponent's belly, badly lacerating both the small and large intestine, spilling fecal matter into the abdominal cavity.He will have to make an immediate Challenging(-10 %) T test or fall unconscious.If successful he'll still be at –20 % to all tests due to pain and shock for the duration of the combat.Such a wound inevitably causes a severe infection and hardly any amount of mun - dane healing in the Old World can repair such damage, the victim usually dying within d10 / 2 days.Should an attempt atHeal with the Surgery Talent be made it will count as Very Hard(-30 %) and even if the surgeon is successful your opponent must still pass a Very Hard(-30 %) T test or succumb to infection anyway.Any successful magical healing attempt will take care of the infection as well but will also be counted as Very Hard(-30 %) unless a successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell has first been performed, in which case it merely counts as Challenging (-10 %).",
        "Your weapon opens your opponent's abdomen, spilling his entrails about his feet.Death will occur within d10 turns unless magical healing as per #11 is obtained.Until that time your opponent can do nothing except futilely try to stuff the spilt entrails back into his ruined abdomen.Anyone surviving such a horrifying experience will gain d10 / 2 IP.",
        'Your weapon slices deep into your opponent, splitting several ribs before severing the spinal cord and lodging in a vertebra.As you yank loose your weapon he falls down and must make an immediate Hard(-20 %) T test or die on the spot.If successful he will be helpless for the duration of the battle and will then be a cripple for the rest of his life, para - lysed from the waist down.No amount of mundane or magi - cal healing, except possibly the direct personal intervention of Shallya herself, could repair such an injury.',
        "You cut deeply into your opponent's chest, staving in ribs and puncturing a lung before splitting the heart and aorta, showering you in a spray of blood.Your opponent spits blood as he slides off your weapon and inevitably dies within the next turn.",
        "Your weapon describes a clean arc through your opponent's chest and belly, practically splitting the poor bugger in half.He dies immediately, falling to the ground in two loosely connected pieces.",

        "Your weapon glances off your opponent's temple, causing momentary disorientation.He suffers a penalty of –20 % on his WS until the end of his next turn.",
        'You slash your opponent across the forehead.The flow of blood into his eyes will cause a penalty of –20 % to his WS until he spends a half action to wipe it away.Each turn after that there is a 30 % risk more blood will flow down, repeat - ing the modifier, possibly occurring again and again until he can take two whole turns to bandage the wound.',
        "The flat of your weapon lands a solid blow to the side of your opponent's head, stunning him.At the start of each of his subsequent turns after the next he must take a T test to recover from it, after which he can fight normally.",
        "You nick a major vein in your opponent's neck, causing heavy bleeding.Until he has two full turns of bandaging and a successful Heal test performed on him, he must, after a number of turns equal to his TB characteristic, start passing a Routine(+10 %) T test each turn, falling unconscious from loss of blood if he fails.",
        "You slice off a large part of one of your opponent's ears, the pain causing a penalty of –20 % to his WS until the end of his next turn.Unless hiding his injury he will also suffer a penalty of –5 % to his Fel in any situation where good looks are important.",
        "Your weapon slices off your opponent's nose as he bends backward in an attempt to dodge your blow.He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and will suffer a permanent –10 % modifier to his Fel.However, he will have a + 10 % bonus modifier to Intimidation tests.A prosthetic nose will halve both modifiers.",
        "You cut deep into your opponent's scalp, chipping the skull.He must make an immediate T test or fall unconscious from the blow.If he succeeds he counts as stunned his next two turns and must then make another T test to recover or remain stunned.",
        "Your weapon crashes into the side of your opponent's head, stunning him until the end of his next turn, severing one ear and ruining his hearing on that side.The unsightly scar across that side of his face reduces his Fel by –10 % (but adds + 10 % to any Intimidation tests) and the hearing loss causes a –15 % penalty to all hearing - related Perception tests.",
        'You slice your opponent across the eyes.There is a 50 % risk for each eye that it is destroyed.If neither eye is destroyed you merely nicked his eyelids and the bridge of his nose, causing severe pain and blood in the eyes, but your opponent still counts as helpless until he makes a successful Challenging(-10 %) T test, starting his attempts on his next turn, and even after succeeding he suffers –20 % to his WS, BS and Ag until he has been properly bandaged after the battle.He then needs to keep the bandages on, effectively blinding him, until he has recovered at least one W.If either eye is destroyed your opponent counts as helpless and partly blinded as above but also must reduce any BS or sight - basedPerception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter.If both eyes are destroyed your opponent is totally blind and helpless.',
        'Your weapon opens a large gash from the forehead to the jaw, cutting across and destroying one eye.He suffers penal - ties as for the loss of one eye as per #11 above but also has his Fel reduced by –20 % due to the horribly disfiguring scar, although he gains a + 10 % bonus to any Intimidation tests.',
        "Your weapon slices through your opponent's lower jaw, causing the loss of several teeth as well as a portion of the tongue.Loss of blood is significant.Your opponent must make an immediate Hard(-20 %) T test or fall unconscious.If he fails he must make another unmodified T test to avoid choking to death on his own blood, unless someone else realizes his predicament with a successful Int or Heal test and rolls him over onto his side to let the blood and gore drain out of his mouth.If conscious he will be stunned for one turn and then suffers a penalty of –20 % to WS and BS due to the pain for the duration of the battle.Scarring will cause penalties as per #12 above.Also he will suffer an additional penalty of –10 % to any tests requiring him to be clearly heard due to speech difficulties from the missing piece of tongue.",
        "Your weapon describes an arc through your opponent's tem - ple, taking off a large chunk of his skull and brain, causing you to be showered by a spray of blood, bone chips and brain matter.No healing in the world will prevent your opponent from expiring in d10 / 2 turns.",
        "Your weapon cleanly severs your opponent's head, causing it to fly d10 - 5 yards in a random direction as twin jets of blood shoot up from the trunk of his neck, the mouth of the head working in a futile attempt to scream as it arcs through the air before death occurs a fraction of a turn later.If the result is zero yards or less, you merely slashed through his throat, giving him a wide new smile, and his head remains attached to his neck, although he'll die almost as quickly.",

    leg: [
        "The flat of your blade strikes your opponent's shin, forcing him to pass a Challenging(-10 %) WP test or drop his weapon and spend until the end of his next turn hopping on one leg, swearing and grasping his bruised shin, losing one half - action while thus occupied.",

        "Your weapon slices into the inside of your opponent's thigh, narrowly missing the femoral artery.The gash causes your opponent great pain and he will have to pass a Hard(-20 %) WP test or drop whatever he holds in one hand(his weapon - hand if he is also using a shield, otherwise he can choose which hand) and clutch at the wound, getting to make an - other test each subsequent turn if he fails in order to let go and perform some other action with that arm.",
        "Your weapon chops into your opponent's thigh lengthwise, causing a great gaping wound and lodging in the thighbone.Your opponent falls to the ground.You must spend a half - action dislodging your weapon and your opponent suffers a penalty of - 20 % to all actions until it is dislodged, at which time he must make a WP test to be able to stand up and hob - ble with a M of 1, suffering a penalty of - 10 % to his WS and–30 % to any Dodge Blow tests, due to pain and poor balance.These penalties remain until his W characteristic is fully recovered.",
        "Your weapon severs large muscles at the back of your opponent's thigh.He falls to the ground and suffers a penalty of –2 to his M and –20 % to any Dodge Blow tests.This penalty remains permanently unless someone passes a Challenging(-10 %) Heal test with the Surgery Talent or magical healing is provided before the target has healed himself up to his fullW characteristic at which point the severed ends of the ten - dons and muscles have shrivelled and contracted so much that successful surgery or healing is impossible.",
        "You cleave your opponent's kneecap, destroying it and knocking him to the ground.He must pass a Very Hard(-30 %) WP test or spend the next d10 turns grasping at his knee in utmost agony, counting as helpless.Passing this test reduces that time to d10 / 2. For the duration of the battle he will be at - 10 % to all tests due to severe pain, and he will suffer a penalty of –2 to his M and –20 % to any Dodge Blow tests from now on.Only magical healing can restore the kneecap's function.",
        "Your weapon cuts into your opponent's knee, almost driving clean through the leg, severing large ligaments connecting the bones of the upper and lower leg.Your opponent falls to the ground and can no longer support himself on that leg, forcing him to move with a crutch in the future(reducing M to 1 and counting any Dodge Blow tests as Very Hard, unless he uses two crutches, raising his M to 2 but allowing no use of any weapon in either hand and retaining the Dodge Blow penalty).Only magical healing can restore the knee, and even that will be difficult, requiring a Challenging(-10 %) spell test.",
