    arm: [
        'Your shot grazes your target’s hand, forcing him to pass a constitution save or drop anything he is holding in that hand.',
        'Your shot nicks the wrist of your target, causing a small but vicious wound. Due to the pain, he’ll suffer a -2 penalty attack rolls until the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot glances off your target’s elbow, sending an electric shock of pain down his arm, making him drop anything he is holding in that hand. The arm is numb and useless for d10/2 turns.',
        'Your shot slices your target’s biceps, exposing red, glistening muscle tissue. He suffers disadvantage to his attack rolls until the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot penetrates the large muscle connecting your target’s shoulder to the upper arm, the arrow/bolt remaining in the wound with the point sticking out the other side. He must pass a DC20 constitution save to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. He also loses use of the arm until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which requires a full action (half an action to break off the head, another to pull the shaft out) either by himself or someone else, plus a successful DC15 constitution save if he does it himself, gritting his teeth against the pain.',
        'Your shot slices the back of your target’s hand, severing tendons and nicking the metacarpal bones between the wrist and fingers. He can still flex his fingers, so he doesn’t drop his weapon, but the distracting sight of twitching tendons and white bone causes disadvantage to his attack rolls until the end of his next turn. Unless magically healed he’ll suffer a permanent -2 penalty to any skill checks requiring fine manipulation made with that hand due to decreased manual dexterity from not being able to open his hand properly.',
        'Your shot transfixes your target’s hand, passing between the metacarpal bones between wrist and fingers, and nailing it to any shield he might be holding in that hand. Until the arrow is removed, as per #5 above, the hand is useless. He also counts as stunned until the end of his next turn and, unless magically healed, will suffer a permanent -1 penalty to any skill checks requiring fine manipulation made with that hand, due to nerve damage to his middle finger.',
        'Your shot transfixes your target’s wrist, resulting in penalties as for #7 above, except that you must pass a DC10 constitution save to recover from the stunning and the penalty will be disadvantage due to the much greater damage to nerves and tendons.',
        'Your shot penetrates your target’s forearm, the point lodging in one of the long bones of the forearm. Your target is stunned for d10/2 turns. The arm is useless until the arrow/bolt is withdrawn, which is very difficult due to the head being firmly embedded in the bone, requiring three full actions either by you or someone else, plus a successful DC20 constitution save if you do it yourself.',
        'Your shot lodges in your target’s elbow, severing the head of one of the long bones of the forearm and jamming the joint at a 90-degree angle. Your target is stunned by blinding pain for d10/2 turns and the arm is useless until his W characteristic has been fully recovered. Also the head of the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn. This requires either a successful DC 10 heal check or, if lacking that skill, a DC20 dexterity save, by someone else. Failure means the head was successfully withdrawn but additional damage means healing is delayed, the target recovering one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W.',
        'Your shot lacerates the target’s biceps muscle, also severing the large artery in the arm. Due to the spurting arterial spray, he will suffer a penalty of -2 to strength and dexterity each turn, losing consciousness when either of those ability scores reaches zero. When he wakes up the arrow/bolt will have to be withdrawn as per #5 above.',
        'Your shot pierces the meaty part of your target’s shoulder near the neck, damaging the brachial plexus, the large bundle of nerves supplying the arm. He must pass a DC20 constitution save to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. Unless magically healed within one day, the paralysis will be permanent, rendering the arm limp and useless. Also, the arrow/bolt will have to be removed as per #10 above.',
        'Your shot shatters your target’s shoulder-blade and severs the large artery branching off from the aorta to the arm and neck, causing massive internal bleeding. An immediate DC20 constitution save is required to avoid falling unconscious. He also suffers a cumulative 10% risk of dying from loss of blood each turn, unless magically healed. If he survives, the arrow/bolt will have to be removed as per #10 above.',
        'Your shot enters your target’s shoulder at an angle and exits through his neck in a spray of blood. Your target sways uncertainly for a moment before his legs buckle and he collapses to the ground, unconscious. Death is inevitable within d10/2 rounds.',
        'Your shot enters through your target’s armpit, embedding itself to the fletching. Your target crumples to the ground, gasping and gurgling for one turn while a soft, sucking noise emanates from the wound, before everything is still.',

    body: [
        'Your shot grazes your target’s side, causing him to flinch and suffer a penalty of -2 to his attack rolls until the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot slices along one rib, slicing the skin to the bone,causing a penalty disadvantage to your target’s attack rolls until the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot pierces your target’s flank just beneath the skin, the arrow/bolt sticking there and causing a penalty of disadvantage to his attack rolls until the end of his next turn, the penalty then reduced to -2 until the projectile is removed, requiring a full action (one half-action to break off the shaft, another half-action to withdraw the stump).',
        'Your shot clips your target’s shoulder, knocking him to the ground.',
        'Your shot lodges under a rib, causing your target intense pain every time he moves, making him suffer a -2 penalty to his attack rolls until the arrow/bolt is removed. This takes two full actions and requires a successful  DC10 heal check or a DC20 slight of hand check. Failure means the shaft broke but the head of the arrow remains lodged in your target’s ribcage, now instead requiring a successful DC20 heal check and six full actions to remove.',
        'Your shot pierces your target’s side, penetrating the wall of muscle and entering his abdominal cavity but missing any internal organs. Your target suffers disadvantage to his attack rolls until the arrow/bolt is removed, requiring two full actions and a successful DC10 heal check or a DC15 slight of hand check. Failure means that the projectile was successfully withdrawn but additional damage was caused, delaying healing, resulting in the target regaining one less W the next time he should have regained one or more W. In addition to delayed healing, the target must pass a DC20 constitution save or suffer an infection within one day, making him delirious and helpless for d10 days. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection.',
        'Your shot sinks into your target’s shoulder (roll d10: 1-5 right, 6-10 left) near the neck, barely missing the top of the lung. Due to the discomfort of having an arrow/bolt sticking out of his body, your target suffers disadvantage to his attack rolls when using that arm, until the projectile is removed. Unfortunately, the point is lodged deep underneath the collarbone, requiring six full turns and either a successful DC10 heal check if proficient or a DC25 dexterity save to avoid puncturing the lung. If this happens, the target suffers a cumulative -2 strength and dexterity each turn, falling unconscious when either of those characteristics reach zero and expiring within another 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided.',
        'Your shot sinks into the target’s belly, felling him to the ground. The projectile has lacerated the intestines, spilling fecal matter into the abdominal cavity. Your target is stunned, requiring a DC20 constitution save to recover from the stunning. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, he’ll suffer disadvantage to all skill checks. Removing the arrow requires three full actions and either a successful DC10 heal check or a DC15 dexterity save. In addition, he must make a DC25 constitution save or die from infection in d10 days (becoming delirious and helpless within one day) unless successful magical healing seals up the lacerations within half that time. Alternatively, a DC25 heal check if proficient can be attempted.',
        'Your shot sinks deep into your target’s stomach just beneath the ribs on his left side and damages the spleen, causing internal bleeding. He is stunned until the end of his next turn and will then suffer a cumulative penalty of -1 to strength and dexterity each turn, falling unconscious when either of those ability scores reaches zero. In addition, penalties until the projectile is removed and subsequent risk of infection is as for #6 above. Fortunately, the bleeding will be brought to a halt by the tough membranous covering of the spleen, containing the damage before your target dies from loss of blood.',
        'Your shot splits your target’s breastbone but loses momentum before piercing his heart. The intense pain makes your opponent helpless until he can pass a DC20 constitution save, reducing it to stunning, requiring another save to recover from that. He can start rolling for those saves at the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot penetrates between your target’s lower ribs, damaging a kidney. The massive bleeding causes a cumulative penalty of -2 to strength and dexterity each turn, your target falling unconscious when either of those ability scores reaches zero. Unless magically healed, he will die from loss of blood in another d10 turns. If he survives the arrow/bolt will need to be removed as for #6 above.',
        'Your shot penetrates your target’s chest, collapsing one lung. He must pass an immediate DC20 constitution save to stay conscious, otherwise suffering -9 to all skill checks, and will also suffer a 20% risk of dying each turn,until magical healing is provided. If he survives, the penalty will be reduced by 3 each week as the lung gradually expands again.',
        'Your shot tears through your target’s chest, damaging the aorta where it connects to the heart. The massive loss of blood causes a cumulative penalty of -2 to strength and dexterity each turn, your target falling unconscious when either of those ability scores reaches zero, then also suffering a cumulative 20% chance of dying each turn as his heart futilely empties his system of blood. Only a 6th level or higher healing spell can save his life.',
        'Your shot tears out through your target’s back, lacerating his liver, severing his abdominal aorta, damaging the spinal cord and felling him helpless to the ground, coughing up blood and bilious fluid. Death is inevitable in d10/2 turns.',
        'Your shot transfixes your target’s heart, killing him instantly.',
    ],
    head: [
        'Your shot nicks your target’s ear, causing a -2 penalty to his attack rolls until the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot grazes your target’s cheek, slicing open a wound that bleeds far more freely than expected. He’ll lose one attack or free parry on his next turn as he clasps one hand to his face.',
        'Your shot grazes your target’s neck, causing him to flinch and suffer a penalty of -20% to his WS until the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot slashes across your target’s ear, almost entirely severing the top third. He counts as stunned until the end of his next turn. In addition the flopping of the detached portion will be very distracting, causing a penalty of -10%to his WS for d10/2 turns. After the battle and any usual Heal tests, an additional DC20 Heal test can be attempted for the purpose of successfully stitching the two parts of the ear back together. This second test does not restore your W characteristic any further.',
        'Your shot grazes your target’s scalp, causing blood to flow into his eyes, as per Cutting Damage to Head #4.',
        'Your shot tears a furrow along your target’s jaw, exposing white bone and teeth. He is stunned until he can pass either a WP or constitution save, starting to roll on the turn after his next. The scarring will be unattractive but will not reduce his Fel by any significant margin.',
        'Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, knocks out a couple of teeth, lacerates the tongue and exits through the opposite cheek. Your target will suffer a penalty of -20% to his WS until the arrow is removed, requiring a full action. If attempting it himself, your target must first pass a constitution save. Failure simply means the arrow remains. After the arrow is removed, the target will spit blood and teeth but suffer only -10% to his WS for the duration of the battle due to pain and the blood trickling down his throat. The tongue and the holes in his cheeks will heal naturally although he’ll suffer a penalty of -20% to any Fel tests requiring speech until his W characteristic is fully restored.',
        'Your shot enters through your target’s neck, burying itself to the fletching. Surprisingly, there is very little blood, the arrow/bolt apparently having missed the major arteries or veins. Until the arrow/bolt is removed all the target’s tests count as DC20. Removal requires either a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent or a DC25 dexterity save. Failure means a major artery was nicked during the removal process and either magical healing or another DC20 Heal test will be required to save him from bleeding to death within d10 turns.',
        'Your shot enters your opponent’s cheek near the nose and drives on into the nasal cavity, crumpling the thin walls to the nearby sinus. Your target will be at -20% to all tests for the remainder of the battle due to blood and bone fragments filling his mouth and nose. He is also stunned for d10 turns and must pass a constitution save or gain one IP extra due to the horrifying experience of seeing an arrow sticking from his face. Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests.',
        'Your shot enters through your target’s cheek, shattering a couple of upper molars and lodging in the mandibular joint between the upper and lower jaw. Your target can no longer either open or close his mouth properly and will suffer a penalty of -30% to all tests until the arrow/bolt is removed, due to extreme pain and the blood filling his mouth. Removal will require a DC15 Heal test or a DC25 dexterity save, taking three full actions. Failure means the arrow remains and a new test cannot be performed until the next day.',
        'Your shot punctures one of your target’s eyeballs, lodging in the bony orbit and causing a clear gelatinous substance to run down his face. The target is stunned until the end of the battle. No amount of mundane or magical healing can restore the eye and he suffers reduction of any BS or sight-based Perception test by half, including any bonus from Talents such as Excellent Vision or Sharpshooter.',
        'Your shot pierces your target’s forehead, penetrating the skull by about an inch or two and damaging one frontal lobe of the brain. The target is stunned for d10 turns. He must then pass a DC20 constitution save or fall unconscious. If he passes he will suffer a penalty of -30% to all tests until the end of the battle and must then pass an additional DC20 constitution save or suffer a lethal infection, making him delirious and helpless within one day, killing him within d10/2 days. A Shallyan Cure Disease spell will cure the infection. Survival will reduce his Fel by -20% due to personality changes and he will also gain a random Insanity.',
        'Your shot enters through one eye, penetrating into the brain and knocking your target unconscious. Death ensues within d10/2 turns unless magical healing is provided, counting as a DC25 spell test. Survival will mean the head of the arrow/bolt remains inside his skull and he will suffer a penalty of -20% to WS, BS, Ag, Int and Fel for the rest of his life due to brain damage.',
        'Your shot slams into your target, coming out through the back of his neck. There is a 25% chance the shot went in through the mouth, turning him into a gruesome sight indeed and severing the spinal cord on the way out, otherwise going in through the throat and severing a carotid artery in a gush of blood. Either way, the target falls to the ground and gurgles for d10/2 turns before dying inevitably.',
        'Your shot spits your target’s head like an apple, killing him instantly, although his body will continue to twitch a bit for d10/2 turns.',

        'Your shot grazes your target’s foot, causing a small but painful wound. He suffers a penalty of -10% to WS until the end of his next turn.',
        'Your shot grazes your target’s ankle, causing him to stumble, losing one attack or free parry on his next turn as he flails his arms.',
        'Your shot glances off your target’s shin. For the next d10/2turns his M is halved, all Dodge Blow tests count as DC20 and he may take no attack actions as he limps and gasps from the pain.',
        'Your shot slams into your target’s kneecap, penetrating about half an inch before tearing out again as the shaft whips around, sending the arrow/bolt spinning crazily through the air. The target is stunned until the end of his next turn and must pass a DC15 constitution save or drop his weapon.',
        'Your shot slices a furrow along your target’s hip. Distracted by the pain and forced to guard his injured side,your target suffers a penalty of -10% to all tests for d10 turns.',
        'Your shot slices across the back of your target’s foot, severing tendons to the toes. The target is stunned until the end of his next turn, then suffers a -2 penalty to his M as well as counting all Dodge Blow tests as DC20 until the end of the battle, as his toes won’t obey him properly, making footing awkward. Unless magical or surgical healing is provided within d10/2 days, M will be permanently reduced by -1.',
        'Your shot transfixes the target’s foot, pinning it to the ground. Until the arrow/bolt is removed, M is reduced to zero, all WS tests count as Challenging (-10%) and all Dodge Blow tests count as DC25. Removal requires two full turns and use of both hands.',
        'Your shot transfixes your target’s calf, fracturing the outer of the two bones of the lower leg. Until the end of the battle all tests are counted as DC20 due to the blinding pain. In addition, until the target’s W characteristic is fully restored, M is reduced by -2 and all Dodge Blow tests count as DC20. Removing the arrow is pretty straightforward, requiring no special tests.',
        'Your shot slams through your target’s knee, the point tearing out the back of the joint. Until the projectile has been removed from the jammed knee, M is reduced to 1 and all Dodge Blow tests count as DC25. Removing the arrow/bolt takes three full actions. Fragments of bone left inside the joint causes the knee to stiffen up and lock itself at inopportune moments, causing a permanent -1 penalty to M and making all Dodge Blow tests count as DC15.',
        'Your shot shatters your target’s shinbone, knocking him to the ground writhing in pain. He counts as helpless for d10/2 turns and is unable to support himself on that leg until the fracture has healed in six weeks. Hopping on one leg counts as having a Move of 1 and all WS and Dodge Blow tests count as DC25. One crutch reduces the difficulty of the tests to DC20 but requires the use of one hand. Two crutches enables you to limp along at a Move of 2 but requires both hands and Dodge Blow tests still count as DC20.',
        'Your shot shatters your target’s kneecap, knocking him to the ground. He is helpless with pain for d10 turns. He remains unable to support himself on that leg until his W characteristic is restored fully. M is permanently reduced by -2 and all Dodge Blow tests will count as DC15 from now on.',
        'Your shot sinks deep into the target’s thigh, cracking the thighbone. Your target falls to the ground, clasping his leg in agony, counting as helpless for d10 turns, then suffers a penalty of -20% to all tests for the duration of the battle due to the agonizing pain. Subsequent penalties and healing are as per #10 above.',
        'Your shot sinks into the target’s thigh, severing the large femoral artery. Your target will suffer a cumulative penalty of -10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn, falling unconscious when any of those ability scores reaches zero. He’ll then die from loss of blood in another d10/2 turns unless magical healing is provided.',
        'Your shot slams into your target’s hip, shattering bone and lacerating nerves and major blood vessels inside the pelvis. Your target falls to the ground, helpless with shock,and expires inevitably in d10/2 turns.',
        'Your shot shatters the femur and lays open the femoral artery, causing your target to fall unconscious to the ground and die inevitably in d10/2 turns in a bright pumping spray of arterial blood.',
