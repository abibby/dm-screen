        "Your bullet grazes your target's hand, forcing him to pass a DC 10 constitution save or drop anything he is holding in that hand.",
        'Your bullet nicks the wrist of your target, causing a small but vicious wound. Due to the pain, he suffers a penalty of -2 to his attack rolls until the end of his next turn.',
        "Your bullet glances off your target's elbow, sending an electric shock of pain down his arm, making him drop anything he is holding in that hand. The arm is numb and useless for d10/2 turns.",
        "Your bullet takes a chunk of your target's biceps muscle with it. He suffers disadvantage on his attack rolls until the end of his next turn.",
        "Your bullet pierces your target's deltoid muscle of the shoulder, lodging just underneath the skin. Your target drops anything held in that hand and suffers a penalty disadvantage on his attack rolls until the end of his next turn. Additionally, until the bullet is removed you can't fully recover your fullW characteristic, effectively having one less W than normal. Removal requires two full turns, a sharp knife and a successful Easy (+20%) Heal test.",
        "Your bullet makes a hole through your target's hand, smashing some of the bones between the wrist and the fingers and severing the tendons to one digit, either the middle or ring finger as the GM deems fit. Anything held in that hand is dropped and the hand is useless until the end of the battle. Afterwards your target will suffer a permanent penalty of -5% to any tests requiring fine manipulation performed with that hand due to reduced manual dexterity, probably simply binding the limp finger to its neighbor to keep it from interfering with any tasks.",
        "Your bullet removes one finger on your target's hand. Roll1d10: 1-2 thumb, 3-4 index finger, 5-6 middle finger, 7-8 ring finger, 9-10 pinkie. Your target is stunned until the end of his next turn. If the thumb is lost, grip will be very poor, reducing WS, Ag and S by a penalty of -20% for any tests or blows made with that hand. Loss of a pinkie is mostly cosmetic in effect and the target can count himself lucky. Loss of any other finger will result in penalties as for #6 above.",
        "Your bullet shatters your target's wrist, smashing the many small wrist-bones and severely damaging nerves and tendons. Anything held in that hand is dropped. Your target counts as stunned and must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping anything held in the opposite hand to grab his injury. At the end of his next turn he must pass a WP test to recover from the stunning, rolling again next turn if he fails. The hand is useless until the target's W characteristic is fully restored. He must then pass a Hard (-20%) T test. Failure means the hand remains next to useless, stiff and with hardly any function left in the fingers. If successful, he'll suffer a permanent penalty of -20% to WS, Ag and S tests (as well as any tests requiring fine manipulation) made with that hand due to stiffness and reduced manual dexterity. Magical healing will heal the injury completely if provided with d10/2 days.",
        "Your bullet lodges in the target's elbow, jamming the joint. Your target is stunned by blinding pain for d10/2 turns and the arm is useless until the bullet is removed. This requires a successful Heal test with the Surgery talent. If this is not provided within d10 days the target must pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or suffer an infection that will render the joint, and the arm, permanently useless. In addition, he must pass a second test or the infection will spread, killing him within another d10 days unless amputation is performed. A successful Shallyan Cure Disease spell will heal the infection but not remove the bullet or restore function in the arm.",

        "Your bullet shatters the bone of your target's upper arm. The target is stunned by blinding pain for d10 turns and the arm is useless. Such an injury requires magical healing within d10 days or it will develop gangrene and need amputation.",
        "Your bullet pierces the meaty part of the target's shoulder near the neck, severing the brachial plexus, the bundle of nerves supplying the arm, and stunning him for d10/2 turns. He must pass a Hard (-20%) WP test to avoid dropping whatever he is holding in the other hand to grasp the injured shoulder. Unless magically healed within one day, which will count as a Hard (-20%) spell test, the paralysis will be permanent, rendering the arm limp and useless. Also, the lodged bullet will permanently reduce his W by -1.",
        "Your bullet shatters your target's shoulder-blade and severs the large artery branching off from the aorta to the arm. The victim of your lethal accuracy will suffer a 30% risk of dying from loss of blood each turn, unless magically healed which will require a Hard (-20%) spell test. Until his W characteristic is fully restored, the pain of his shattered shoulder-blade will make all tests connected with any physical activity count as Very hard (-30%). Also, the lodged bullet will permanently reduce his W by -1 if he survives.",

        "Your bullet pierces your target's flank at a sharp angle, lodging underneath the skin. He suffers a penalty of -30% to his WS until the end of his next turn. In addition, the bullet also brought with it a small piece of wadding or the target's clothing into the wound, causing an infection that will delay his healing process, meaning he'll recover one less W the next time he should have restored some of his W characteristic.",
        "Your bullet clips your target's shoulder, spinning him almost completely around and knocking him to the ground, stunned until the end of his next turn. Apart from that dramatic effect, the wound is comparatively minor.",
        'Your bullet lodges under a rib, causing your target intense pain every time he moves, making him suffer a -10% penalty to his WS until the bullet is removed. This requires a successful Heal test with the Surgery Talent. Failure will result in infection as per #3 above.',
        "Your bullet smashes into your target's back at a sharp angle and clips a vertebra in the spine of the small of the back, causing temporary paralysis from the shock of impact. Your target falls to the ground, unable to use his legs for d10 turns, before recovering completely.",
        "Your bullet hits your target's shoulder-blade at a sharp angle, shattering itself on impact. The fragments tear away a massive amount of flesh from the surface of the shoulder-blade, white bone showing clearly through the ragged hole they leave as they exit. Your target is stunned for d10 turns and suffers a penalty of -20% to all tests from pain and ruined muscle tissue until the end of the battle. The penalty is then reduced to -10% until his W characteristic is fully restored.",

He is then left lying on the ground, blood running from his mouth and a bubbling noise emanating from the hole in his chest. He'll die in 2d10 turns unless magical healing is provided. If he survives he'll suffer a penalty of -30% to all tests for one week, reducing the penalty by 10% for each subsequent week, before recovering when the lung has inflated itself again.",
        "Your bullet slams into your target's belly, knocking him sprawling, stunned until the end of his next turn. The liver has been penetrated and he'll suffer a cumulative penalty of -10% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn due to internal bleeding, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. He'll die in another d10 turns unless magical healing is provided.",
        "Your bullet smashes a lower rib and ruins one kidney. Your target is knocked sprawling, helpless until the end of his next turn. He'll suffer a cumulative penalty of -15% to WS, BS, Ag and S each turn due to massive internal bleeding, falling unconscious when any of those characteristics reaches zero. He'll die in d10 turns unless magical healing is provided, and even that will count as a Hard (-20%) spell test.",
        "Your bullet smashes your target's breastbone, shattering it and driving fragments deeper into the chest. Your target will have to pass a Challenging (-10%) T test or die on the spot, his heart pierced. If he survives he'll count as helpless for d10 turns, then suffer a penalty of -30% to all tests until his W characteristic is fully restored, due to problems breathing, practically every rib disconnected from his shattered breastbone. After one day he'll have to pass a Hard (-20%) T test or contract pneumonia due to not being able to cough up phlegm properly, dying within d10/2 days unless a Shallyan Cure Disease spell saves him.",
        "Your bullet punches clear through your target's belly, exiting from his back in a spray of blood and tissue.
